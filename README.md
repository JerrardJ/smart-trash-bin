# Smart Trash Bin
A smart trash bin capable of automatically opening its lid and providing a visual alert when it is nearly full. This prototype utilizes an Arduino Uno and two ultrasonic sensors. One sensor is positioned on the outside to detect nearby objects, triggering the lid to open automatically using a micro-servo motor attached to the bin’s lid. The second sensor is installed inside the bin to measure the height of accumulated waste and determine when the capacity is almost full.

- Green LED — Indicates that the lid is open
- Red LED — Indicates that the trash bin is almost full
